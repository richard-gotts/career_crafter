# Career Crafter

This is a set of two programs which collect and validate employer requirements and applicant details.

The current workings of the programs are as follows:

- Applicants can enter their details by running the 'career_crafter_applicants.py' program.
- Once they have successfully added all their details, a .txt file is created in the 'Applications' folder.
- The employer can then enter their requirements by running the 'career_crafter_employers.py' program.
- Once they have successfully added their requirements, the program will read in each application and generate a .txt report for that application.
- For applications which may be successful, the reports are added to the 'Employer Reports\\Successful Applications' folder.
- For applications which are unsuccessful, the reports are added to the 'Employer Reports\\Unsuccessful Applications' folder.

To use the set of programs, please ensure that you store the program files and 'Applications' and 'Employer Reports' folders in the same working directory. The 'Employer Reports' folder should contain two sub-folders: 'Successful Applications' and 'Unsuccessful Applications'.

I appreciate that this is a rather primitive setup and would not be anywhere near suitable for a real career match site! The main purpose of this project was to practise reading and writing .txt files and input validation.

The vision with this project would be to have online portals for the employer and applicants - I hope to learn more soon about how to implement this!
